# Graf CLass // C++

A class implemented in order to use graph algorithms to solve graph-based problems as quickly and easily as possible.

This class lists algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Roy-Floyd and Prim that help solve problems of strongly connected directed graph, critical connections and diameter of a binary tree.

These algorithms have been tested on various coding platforms such as Infoarena and LeetCode.
